# OFFT benchmark

I use this code to perform a runtime comparison of my own OFFT library against the FFTW and the Intel oneMKL.

For more information visit <https://github.com/christian-volmer/OFFT/blob/main/doc/OfftSpeedComparison.md>.

Be sure to install all necessary libraries and adjust the paths in `/CMakeLists.txt`.
